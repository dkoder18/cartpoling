# cartpoling

A machine learning project using python where a cart learns to balance the pole.
The pole is fed random coordinates with a randomizer (upto 20 coords per second) and the cart predicts its next coordinate in order to keep the pole balanced.
This process is perfected using Reinforcement Learning.
